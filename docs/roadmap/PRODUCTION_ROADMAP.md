# DTMO Production Readiness Roadmap

## Purpose

This roadmap defines the controlled path from DTMO's current release-candidate state to production readiness. It is executed through bounded PDCA runs and tracked in GitHub issue #3.

The release rule is strict: no phase is complete without objective evidence. Missing CI, security, recovery, performance, accessibility, operational or external-assurance evidence blocks production readiness.

## Current status — 2026-08-09

- Phase 1 — CI and workflow integrity: `PASS`.
- Phase 2 — Application security and identity: `PASS` for internal gates.
- Phase 3 — Data integrity and recovery: `PASS` for internal gates.
- Phase 4 — Live connector reliability and provenance: `PASS` for internal gates.
- Phase 5 — Performance and scalability: `PASS` for internal gates.
- Phase 6 — Frontend accessibility and operational UX: `BLOCKED_EXTERNAL` only for genuine VoiceOver/NVDA execution on supported real hosts.
- Phase 7 — Observability and incident operations: `IN PROGRESS`; RC10.1–RC10.4 accepted. Normal progression remains deferred until the higher-severity object-storage migration is accepted.
- Phase 8 — Staging acceptance: `NOT STARTED`.
- Phase 9 — External assurance: `NOT COMPLETE`; tracked in issue #1.
- Phase 10 — Production go/no-go: `NOT STARTED`.

## Accepted Phase 7 evidence

- RC10.1 request observability: `PASS` — PR #80.
- RC10.2 controlled connector-failure alerting: `PASS` — PR #82.
- RC10.3 bounded queue-backlog alerting: `PASS` — PR #84.
- RC10.4 bounded storage-integrity alerting: `PASS` — PR #86.

Phase 7 remains incomplete because distributed tracing, API-error/search-health alerting, dashboards, runbooks, on-call handover and ownership/escalation evidence remain open.

## Higher-severity object-storage remediation

Fresh storage-layer threat intelligence established that `docker-compose.yml` pins legacy MinIO `RELEASE.2025-07-23T15-54-02Z`, within affected ranges for later advisories. RUN-20260809-131 established that the former community runtime is archived/unmaintained and therefore cannot satisfy the supported-runtime production gate.

RUN-20260809-132 resolves the **target-selection** blocker by accepting ADR-0001:

**Supported target:** MinIO AIStor Enterprise Lite or AIStor Enterprise with an active paid support entitlement. For Enterprise Lite, DTMO requires the separately purchased direct-to-engineer support option for production acceptance.

Production migration constraints:

- vendor-supported production topology;
- `quay.io/minio/aistor/minio` or approved private mirror;
- current supported release pinned by immutable release tag and image digest; `latest` prohibited for accepted production manifests;
- license/SUBNET, administrative/root and least-privilege application S3 credentials separated and injected outside source control;
- TLS/network encryption and server-side encryption required before production acceptance;
- AIStor Free rejected for production because vendor documentation states no SLA/SLO/service agreement and an insufficient distributed/support profile;
- legacy `minio/minio` and unsupported source builds remain rejected.

The target decision does not accept the migration. Security, recovery, storage-integrity and full-regression evidence must be rerun on the migration exact head. Commercial entitlement/support and remaining deployment/secrets gates remain external.

## Phase 1 — CI and workflow integrity

Objectives: regression-protect release-critical workflows, validate triggers/jobs/permissions/services/artifacts, make execution observable, and fail closed on missing/malformed gates.

Blocking gates: workflow contract tests pass; required jobs/triggers are validated; workflow evidence is observable; failed/absent workflows cannot be interpreted as success.

## Phase 2 — Application security and identity

Objectives: enterprise identity or hardened trust boundary, strong RBAC/separation of duties, privileged audit logging, SAST/dependency/secrets/container scanning.

Blocking gates: authentication/authorization and negative RBAC tests pass; no hardcoded production secrets; no unresolved critical security-scan findings.

## Phase 3 — Data integrity and recovery

Objectives: validate PostgreSQL migrations/constraints, raw-object immutability/checksums, backup/retention/restoration, and full clean restoration.

Blocking gates: migration cycle succeeds; restore test succeeds; provenance/checksum integrity survives; RTO/RPO are documented and tested.

## Phase 4 — Live connector reliability and provenance

Objectives: controlled live canaries, credentials/rate limits/licences/terms validation, retry/backoff/dedup/source health/failure isolation, retained source/timestamp/confidence/raw evidence.

Blocking gates: connector contracts pass; canaries repeat; malformed/duplicate records quarantine; connectors cannot publish without human review.

## Phase 5 — Performance and scalability

Objectives: representative education-sector volumes, API/PostgreSQL/OpenSearch/ingestion load tests, latency/throughput/resource budgets, queue pressure and degraded dependencies.

Current decision: `PASS` for bounded internal gates. Issue #1 retains independent representative production load/stress acceptance.

## Phase 6 — Frontend accessibility and operational UX

Objectives: browser E2E, critical analyst/CISO/audit workflows, responsive/keyboard behavior, bounded WCAG evidence and separately genuine assistive-technology behavior.

Current decision: `BLOCKED_EXTERNAL` only for genuine VoiceOver/NVDA evidence on supported real host/browser/screen-reader combinations. Browser/DOM automation is not a substitute.

## Phase 7 — Observability and incident operations

Objectives:
- service-level metrics, structured logs and traces;
- alerting for connector failures, queue backlog, storage integrity, API errors and search health;
- incident/outage/recovery/connector-failure runbooks;
- dashboards and on-call handover guidance.

Blocking gates:
- alerts tested with controlled failures;
- logs/metrics provide correlation IDs and actionable evidence;
- runbooks complete and exercised;
- operational ownership/escalation documented.

Current decision: `IN PROGRESS`. RC10.1–RC10.4 are accepted. RC10.5 remains deferred until the supported object-storage migration is implemented and accepted.

Exactly one next priority: implement the bounded migration from legacy `minio/minio` to the accepted AIStor target using an immutable supported release and external license/secret boundary, then execute relevant security, recovery, storage-integrity and full regression gates with retained exact-head evidence. Only after that gate is accepted should Phase 7 resume with RC10.5 API-error alerting.

## Phase 8 — Staging acceptance

Objectives: production-equivalent deployment, smoke/integration/migration/connector/recovery/performance/accessibility tests, secrets/TLS/network restrictions.

Blocking gates: reproducible staging; all internal gates pass; no unresolved blockers; deployment evidence retained.

## Phase 9 — External assurance

Tracked in issue #1: independent penetration test, representative load/stress, full backup/restoration exercise, production OpenSearch hardening, required secrets-management acceptance, operational/stakeholder approvals and production deployment acceptance.

## Phase 10 — Production go/no-go

Go requires every prior phase and external gate complete with retained evidence, green CI, release notes/SBOM/deployment manifest/rollback plan, proven recovery and required approvals. Any missing blocking evidence is `NO-GO`.

## PDCA execution order

Each run performs exactly one bounded objective in roadmap order unless a higher-severity blocker is discovered or an earlier phase is blocked only by an explicitly external dependency that cannot be executed in the current environment.

1. Phase 1 — CI and workflow integrity.
2. Phase 2 — Application security and identity.
3. Phase 3 — Data integrity and recovery.
4. Phase 4 — Live connector reliability and provenance.
5. Phase 5 — Performance and scalability.
6. Phase 6 — Frontend accessibility and operational UX.
7. Phase 7 — Observability and incident operations.
8. Phase 8 — Staging acceptance.
9. Phase 9 — External assurance coordination.
10. Phase 10 — Production go/no-go.

Every run must document Plan, Do, Check and Act, update run/QA evidence, preserve claim boundaries, and leave exactly one next priority.
